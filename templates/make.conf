# Global USE flags
# `-bindist`       - Only needed if we want binaries to *redistribute* (not just to *run*, which would be signified by -bin), but causes conflicts for GNOME.
# `-cups`          - We don't want CUPS support really so let's just not build it.
# `-qt5`           - We don't want Qt stuff as we're GTK.
# `networkmanager` - Builds NetworkManager support into packages which support it.
